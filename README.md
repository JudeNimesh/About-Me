I am a full-stack Java software developer with recent experience building multi-tiered web applications. I went to school at Eastern Nazarene College where I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering Physics and Computer Enginerring. I recently changed career paths to enter the technology field because I learned how to program in Java during a class project diving into computational aerospace and I really enjoyed the process of coding. In a few years, my goal is to become a senior developer so that I can mentor others.

During my time at Company, I’ve worked on several projects where I gained experience in both backend technologies (including Java, SQL, Spring framework, and Hibernate architecture) as well as frontend development (including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Angular). I also have experience with DevOps and using CI/CD pipelines, deploying to the Azure cloud. I really enjoy collaborative team environments where I can learn from others, and I have worked hard to improve my interpersonal and communication skills. For my latest project, I played a major role which involves facilitating the daily standups and helping to resolve any blockers my teammates have. I look forward to applying all of my skills and prior experience in a position on your team.
